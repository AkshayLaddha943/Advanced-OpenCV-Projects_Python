1. A blob is a group of connected pixels in an image that shares some common property.

2. The centroid of a shape is the arithmetic mean of all the points in a shape.

3. We can find center of blob usi	ng moments. 

4. Image moments is a particular weighted average of image pixels intensities to find
     properties  like radius, area, centroid,etc.

5. Cx (x-coordinate of the Centroid) = M10/M00
     Cy (y-coordinate of Centroid) = M01/M00
     M = Moment

I. Convert Image to Grayscale
II. Perform Binarization on the image
III. Find the center of the image after calculating moments1
